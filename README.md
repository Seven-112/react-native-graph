## Usage

function App() {
  const priceHistory = usePriceHistory('ethereum')

  return <LineGraph points={priceHistory} />

### `enablePanGesture`

Whether to enable the pan gesture.

There are three events fired when the user interacts with the graph:

1. `onGestureStart`: Fired once the user presses and holds down on the graph. The pan gesture _activates_.
2. `onPointSelected`: Fired for each point the user pans through. You can use this event to update labels or highlight selection in the graph.
3. `onGestureEnd`: Fired once the user releases his finger and the pan gesture _deactivates_.

Example:

```jsx
<LineGraph
  points={priceHistory}
  enablePanGesture={true}
  onGestureStart={() => hapticFeedback('impactLight')}
  onPointSelected={(p) => updatePriceTitle(p)}
  onGestureEnd={() => resetPriceTitle()}
/>
```
