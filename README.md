# ðŸ“ˆ react-native-graph

Beautiful, high-performance Graphs/Charts for React Native.

yarn add react-native-graph
```

## Usage

```jsx
function App() {
  const priceHistory = usePriceHistory('ethereum')

  return <LineGraph points={priceHistory} />
}
```

### `animated`

  animated={true}
/>
```

### `enablePanGesture`

<img src="./img/pan.gif" align="right">

Whether to enable the pan gesture.

There are three events fired when the user interacts with the graph:

1. `onGestureStart`: Fired once the user presses and holds down on the graph. The pan gesture _activates_.
2. `onPointSelected`: Fired for each point the user pans through. You can use this event to update labels or highlight selection in the graph.
3. `onGestureEnd`: Fired once the user releases his finger and the pan gesture _deactivates_.
